    <p>lamboPo, is an American daily newspaper. The Post is a global news outlet: It is published in Washington, D.C.,[5] operates international breaking news hubs in London, England, and Seoul, South Korea,[6] and is the most widely circulated newspaper in the Washington metropolitan area.[7][8]</p>
    <p>The Post was founded in 1877. In its early years, it went through several owners and struggled both financially and editorially. Financier Eugene Meyer purchased it out of bankruptcy in 1933 and revived its health and reputation; this work was continued by his successors Katharine and Phil Graham (Meyer's daughter and son-in-law), who bought out several rival publications.</p>
    <p>The Post's 1971 printing of the Pentagon Papers helped spur opposition to the Vietnam War. Reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein led the investigation into the break-in at the Democratic National Headquarters that developed into the Watergate scandal, which resulted in the 1974 resignation of President Richard Nixon.</p>
    <p>In October 2013, the Graham family sold the newspaper to Nash Holdings, a holding company owned by Jeff Bezos, for $250 million.</p>
